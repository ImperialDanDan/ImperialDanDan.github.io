			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>
My major research interests lie at the intersection of robotics and machine learning. 
I work on micro-manipulation, teleoperation, human-robot shared control for robotic surgery and robot learning for manipulation. 
I am looking forward to doing high impact research in the field of robotics.
The previous projects I worked on cover research topics of robotics (mobile robots and manipulators, human-robot interaction, master manipulator design), 
sensing (sensor network, internet of things, localization and navigation, Brain Computer Interface), vision (obstacles detection, images classification) 
and MEMS based micro thruster arrays (focus on control strategy and optimization).
