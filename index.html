    <h1> Dr. Dandan Zhang </h1>
    <p> Dandan Zhang is a lecturer (equal to Assistant Professor) at Department of Engineering Mathematics, University of Bristol (UoB). She is also  affiliated to Bristol Robotics Lab (BRL).
        Before coming to Bristol, I did my PhD at the Hamlyn Center for Robotics, Department of Computing, Imperial College London.<br>
     My major research interests lie at the intersection of robotics and machine learning.
        The ultimate goal is to develop the next-generation robots empowered by artificial intelligence with super-human capabilities. 
        I envision that intelligent robots will reshape our world by providing tangible benefits in our daily life, 
        contributing to the healthcare system or assisting humans in hazardous environments.
       In addition, I also work on micro-robotics, teleoperation, human-robot shared control.   

The previous projects I worked on cover research topics of robotics (mobile robots and manipulators, human-robot interaction, master manipulator design), 
sensing (sensor network, internet of things, localization and navigation, Brain Computer Interface), 
vision (obstacles detection, images classification) and MEMS based micro thruster arrays (focus on control strategy and optimization). All the experiences acquired from my academic courses, extra-curricular activities, research opportunities make me know what I expect in my further research.
