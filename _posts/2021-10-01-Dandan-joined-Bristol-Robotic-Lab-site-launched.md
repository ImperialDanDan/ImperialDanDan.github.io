Having recently joined BRL, I wanted to get in touch to introduce myself, please find my picture attached. <br>

My name is Dandan Zhang. I am a new lecturer in robotics at the Engineering Mathematics Department, University of Bristol. <br>
Before I come to Bristol, I spent few years in London, doing research at the Hamlyn Centre for Robotic Surgery, Computing Department, Imperial College London.  <br>
My major research interests lie at the intersection of robotics and machine learning. <br>
I work on micro-manipulation, teleoperation, human-robot shared control for robotic surgery in the past few years. My work in BRL will focus on robot learning for dexterous manipulation, tactile robotics, and may explore micro-robotic system design in the future. <br>

Outside of work, I enjoy dancing, especially Ballet and Chinese classical dance. I also enjoy watching films and dramas.<br>
