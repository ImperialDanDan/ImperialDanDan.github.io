It's my great pleasure to join Bristol Robotics Lab (BRL). BRL is the UKâ€™s largest academic centre for multi-disciplinary robotics research.                              
It's constructed based on a unique collaboration between University of the West of England (UWE Bristol) and University of Bristol (UoB).
